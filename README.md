## My process

### Built with
- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned
This project let me refresh my basic knowledge about Flexbox, CSS and HTML5, so I can move on to creating more complex pages with the usage of  CSS grid. It's also my first time creating README.

### Continued development
I want to play around with CSS grid, media queries and semantic HTML to feel more comfortable with it. I have basic understaning of JS, so most of all I want to start using it, to create interacive pages.
